<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate and dedicated B.Tech CSE (Data Science) student with strong foundations in web development and data structures. My skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Python, SQL, and C++, which I continuously enhance through hands-on projects and structured learning. As a trainee at NxtWave’s CCBP 4.0 Academy, I’ve built dynamic web applications integrating APIs, form validations, and responsive design principles that reflect both technical precision and creativity.</p>

<p>My curiosity extends beyond coding—I actively explore cutting-edge technologies like Generative AI and Machine Learning. I’ve participated in workshops and events focused on prompt engineering, MVP building, and product-market fit, showing my ability to apply technical knowledge to real-world problems. At the same time, I value personal development and leadership, attending sessions on emotional intelligence and productivity to become a well-rounded engineer ready for impactful teamwork</p>

<p>I strongly believe in learning by doing and sharing that journey. I regularly post updates on my learning progress and technical insights on LinkedIn, where I’ve built an engaging presence. From building projects and solving algorithm problems to reflecting on topics like time management and tech careers, I strive to grow every day as a developer and problem solver. My goal is to contribute to meaningful products and work with teams that value innovation, learning, and positive impact.</p>
